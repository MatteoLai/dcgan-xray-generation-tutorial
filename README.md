# DCGAN Tutorial: Generating X-ray Hand Images
This repository contains a hands-on tutorial for training a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) to generate synthetic X-ray images of hands using the MedNIST dataset.
It was created for educational purposes as part of a Master's course in Artificial Intelligence for Medicine.

The included Jupyter notebook provides the full solution, covering data loading, model definition, and training.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn
- How to load and preprocess medical imaging data (MedNIST)
- How to define a DCGAN architecture using PyTorch Lightning
- How to train a GAN and visualize generated outputs

## 🚀 Quick Start
Run the notebook on Google Colab:  
👉 [**Open in Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MatteoLai/dcgan-xray-generation-tutorial/blob/main/Tutorial_GAN_training-solutions.ipynb)

## 📜 License
This project is licensed under the MIT License.  
The MedNIST dataset is freely available for research and educational use.
